# Cheers!

True! it is working now! 



I can now write the md file down via Typora and then react-markdown helps me to convert it and render to the component HAHAHA! 



THAT IS SO COOL!



edit: now I use react-syntax-highlighter to improve UI of code snippets and make changes on some css making it more tidy. So yeah... cheers
